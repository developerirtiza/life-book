😳 Embarrassments

Use these as demo inputs.

## 1. Beach Day

I finally visited the beach today with some friends. The sun was warm, the breeze felt amazing, and we even collected seashells. I dropped my phone in the sand and had to clean it for 20 minutes, but it was worth it.

## 2. Fishing Trip

This evening, I sat by the dock and tried fishing for the first time. The water looked beautiful under the sunset. I was proud to catch a small fish, but I made a mistake and let it slip right back in. Still, the peace and silence were worth it.

## 3. Never Saw a Sunset

I realized today that I’ve never seen a full sunset with my own eyes. I’ve seen photos, sure, but never sat down to watch one happen. It made me feel weirdly empty for a second.

## 5. Mountain Hike

Went hiking in the mountains this afternoon. The air was cool and refreshing, and the view from the top was insane. I forgot to bring sunscreen though and now my nose is red and sore.

Stayed home all day and watched cartoons while eating cereal. I didn’t do anything productive, but I think my brain needed a break. Still feel a little guilty about wasting the day.

Had to give a presentation in front of the whole class today. I forgot my intro and had to improvise. My voice cracked halfway through, but at least I finished it.

## 10. Quiet Library Day

Went to the library and picked up a poetry book. Sat alone in the corner reading verses I didn’t fully understand but really felt. It was quiet and kind of beautiful.
